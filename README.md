# Diabetes-Prediction
🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project implements a machine learning-based system to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various medical parameters. The primary goal is to assist in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare by analyzing patient data and providing accurate predictions.

🎯 Project Objectives
->Predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on health metrics

->Improve early diagnosis through data-driven methods

->Enable healthcare practitioners and patients to make informed decisions

📊 Dataset
->Dataset Used: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset

Features:

->Pregnancies

->Glucose
